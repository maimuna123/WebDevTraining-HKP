<h3>Information About Me: </h3> 
  <p>I am a junior at Townsend Harris High School located in New York City.</p>
  <p>At Townsend, I have been a part of S!NG, Table Tennis, Model UN, ESTEEM, and the Phoenix, which is our schoolâ€™s magazine. In my freetime, I like to sing and read books because that's what helps me relax. My favorite subjects in school are math and history.During the summertime, I have volunteered with Kissena Synergy and at Elmhurst Hospital to help give back to my community. I have also attended a few summer programs to hone my computer science and coding skills. </p>
  <p>I have always wanted to get a cat, but my mom is allergic to them so I can't actually adopt one. However, I still like advocating for different issues that help the protection of all animals. If you click on the cats page you can see a few statistics and reasons as to why adopting a cat (from a shelter specifically) can help give these animals a home. </p>
  <p>Social justice has also been an important aspect of my life. In Model UN we assess different current events, and I am also taking an Urban Affluence class at my local community college where we learn about the issues gone through many in low economic households. I created the movie review page specifically to discuss different films I have watched that advocate for a numerous number of different causes.

  <h2>Main Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Some of  my main hobbies include reading,  singing, and playing the guitar. I've been in chorus since the 4th grade and I continue to be in my school's chorus as well. I have been in S!NG since my freshman year and that is where I met most of my friends. S!NG is a competetiton between the Freshiors (Freshmen and Juniors) and the Semores (the sophomores and the seniors) where we then have a main performance to see all the different aspects put together. I just started to read more over quarantine just so I could escape into imaginations of the characaters I read about. In terms of computer science, I started to learn how to code since 7th grade in my middle school's technology class. I have also loved reading history like its a repeating story book; I am in my school's Model UN where I go to many of the conferences to learn more about current events.</p>

  <h2>Main Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Some of  my main hobbies include reading,  singing, and playing the guitar. I've been in chorus since the 4th grade and I continue to be in my school's chorus as well. I have been in S!NG since my freshman year and that is where I met most of my friends. S!NG is a competetiton between the Freshiors (Freshmen and Juniors) and the Semores (the sophomores and the seniors) where we then have a main performance to see all the different aspects put together. I just started to read more over quarantine just so I could escape into imaginations of the characaters I read about. In terms of computer science, I started to learn how to code since 7th grade in my middle school's technology class. I have also loved reading history like its a repeating story book; I am in my school's Model UN where I go to many of the conferences to learn more about current events.</p>

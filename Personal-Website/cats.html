<h3>ASPCA Statistics on Animal shelters:</h3> 
<!-- Reasons to get a cat -->
<p>Adopting a cat from a shelter is very important; approximately "6.5 million companion animals" enter animal shelters in the U.S. annually, and  approximately 3.2 million were cats.  Adopting from a shelter will help these animals find a safe, loving home. If you adopt a cat from a shelter, then you will help break the pattern of pet overpopulation. There are insufficient homes for all these animals. Adopting from shelters will help break this overpopulation cycle.</p>

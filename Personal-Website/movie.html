<!-- BlacKkKlansman -->

<h3> BlacKkKlansman  </h3> 
<p>The 2018 drama/crime film, BlacKkKlansman, directed by Spike Lee reveals the brutality towards African Americans in society. The film is loosely based on historical events during the 1970s, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. These events follow Ron Stallworth, the first African American detective in the local police department, on a mission to expose the Ku Klux Klan. This film presents the social issue of racism in today’s society, as shown through the ending sequence of the film when Lee breaks the fourth wall. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman is a captivating film because Lee portrays the argument that power and entitlement in this country have resulted in its people going through extreme lengths to preserve their superiority. Lee's movie is a cry to try to show the world how we have allowed racism to progress throughout history into today, and how we should no longer stray away from the topic that deserves more attention. 
</p>
<p>In the film, Ron Stallworth is the first African American police detective to work in the Colorado Springs Police Department where he sets out to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A more experienced detective, Flip Zimmerman, is then recruited into this undercover investigation to be the face of the operation. The two detectives then work together to bring the white supremacist hate group down as the Klansmen attempt to spread their message and make it mainstream. </p>
<p>Spike Lee creates a perfect combination of emotions whilst completely representing all the topics. He incorporates code-switching to show how many of us blend in with others in order to not feel left out. The editing style that was most frequently used was overlapping audio in between different shots to add suspense to the scenes. Spike Lee breaks the fourth wall at the end of the film to help create tension and leave the audience captivated by how real everything is.</p> 
<p>Racism has been prevalent throughout the entirety of this country’s history as shown in the film, and many elements help break the fourth wall to compare the film to modern society as a representation of the lack of change in this country. Although we may believe that racism isn’t as prevalent as it was before, it is still prominent today. Culture hasn’t changed between closed-minded people, and this is portrayed when Spike Lee shows that America is in distress through the upside-down, black and white flag representing how we only see things as black and white, not as they really are, which is what I believe Spike Lee also attempts to convey to the audience throughout this film.

<h3>Norma Rae</h3> 
<p style="padding:50px"> Norma Rae, played by Sally Field, works at the local textile mill. Her wages are not fair at all in terms of the extended periods of time and hazardous working conditions (deafness and word related lung illnesses were normal). Subsequent to hearing an energizing discourse by work lobbyist Reuben (Ron Leibman), Norma is motivated to revitalize her kindred specialists behind the reason for unionism. Her choice irritates her family, particularly her life partner, Sonny (Beau Bridges), and incites no lack of scorn from her managers. In the movie, Norma Rae, the opening sequence represents the intensity and laborious life of the working class in 1973 based on the soundtrack through the use of juxtaposition when it cuts from the light-hearted song to the loud sound of the machines. There is a long shot showing the entire factory and the sound of the machines makes the audience not even want to hear it which only intensifies the reasoning as to how horrendous working conditions were. The film depends on a genuine story. This film is truly empowering and represents the importance of fighting back against economic disparites in contemporary society.

<h3> Bowling for Columbine</h3> 
<!-- Favorite foods  -->
<p> This documentary's filmmaker, Michael Moore, investigates the conditions that lead to the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and, all the more comprehensively, the multiplication of firearms in America. </p>
<p>Michael Moore uses satire frequently throughout the film. He used his own childhood scenes to show how he got an NRA diploma and show how he was very good at shooting guns. He uses happy, old-timey music to then show how everything was “perfect” back then with scenes of young white kids playing with guns. These scenes illustrate how unaware people are of the consequences of handing a child a firearm, blinded by their innocence. He did this to apply to pathos and use satire to explain how although many parents believe that training their young kids how to use a gun is vital to their set of skills, they are very much unaware of the true, horrendous consequences. </p>
<p> Gun control has been a controversial topic that has been discussed over the past several years in the United States. These gun laws shape the US and impact the safety of their residents. The film tackles this issue very well, and it incorporates different viewpoints and uses satire to show how insane varying viewpoints are.  </p>
